1. Design database: In which kind of transactional database relationship (one to one, one to many, many to one and many to many), we would one extra mapping table in between two tables.

e.g: we have ER diagram where the relationship between parent and child table etc. Every transactional db will have table which might share diff types of relationship like 1-1 etc.. in which of these relationship we would need one extra mapping table to complete  relationship between two tables.

2.  if i want a column to be a unique and my table has already the primary key, what should i do to make this as unique.? can we define unique constrain ? 

3. Remove the consecutive repeating characters from a string. use data structure to do this. which data structure you use? is it optimised? maintainability ?  

e.g:  
Input : aabbccddefg
Output: efg

4. Reverse the vowels in the string. Any data structure to do this? (linked list or any other data structure to reverse)

5. write function to tell a character is a vowel or not? how will you identify vowel in the string , optimal solution. (can we use hash set to maintain the vowels?)


6. How can you connect to the server, which is running inside a container from a local machine?
a) This container is running on ur laptop only and u have a server running inside your container, how can u connect a client from ur laptop which talks to a server in the container?

what command would you write to start that? 

7. How do you connect to Mongo DB? write code.

8. how to look at your DR carrier path progression? how do you do that planning?



9. Given string of array, get all possible combination of substring and then get the count sustring which contains  of vowels in it. wt is the time complexity. ... If i want complexity o(1) what should i do? 

e.g: abc
possible combinations: abc, ab, ac, bc 
output :
  count:3
  
10.   you have student class, u have overridden only the equals method and not the hash code method. you have created two different objects of student class and ur putting into collection, how many objects will be there in collection?

a) if i override hash code method and returning 1 as value, then wt will happen?

11. what performance criteria used?

12. how do you handle data skewness issue?

13. what is the difference between cache and persist in spark?

14.
