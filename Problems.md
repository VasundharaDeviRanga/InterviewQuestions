1.	**LRU Design:**

  LRU, or Least Recently Used, is a popular algorithm used in computer science to manage cache memory. It works on the principle of discarding the least recently used items first when the cache becomes full.
  
  When designing an LRU cache, there are a few key steps to consider:
  Choose a data structure: Typically, a hash table and a doubly linked list are used to implement an LRU cache. The hash table is used to store key-value pairs, while the linked list is used to maintain the order in which the items were accessed.
  Define the maximum cache size: This is the maximum number of items that the cache can hold at any given time. When the cache reaches its maximum size, the least recently used item will be discarded to make room for the new item.
  Implement the operations: The LRU cache typically supports two operations: get and put. When an item is retrieved using the get operation, it is moved to the front of the linked list to indicate that it has been accessed recently. When a new item is added using the put operation, it is added to the front of the linked list and the least recently used item is removed from the end of the linked list.
  Handle edge cases: When designing an LRU cache, it is important to consider edge cases such as cache hits, cache misses, and what happens when the cache size is smaller than the number of items that need to be cached.
  Overall, designing an LRU cache requires careful consideration of data structures, maximum cache size, and cache management operations.
